These were trial work assignments:

Create a Views view within the theme package and export it as a separate module.	
Provide minimal necessary documentation describing the installation and structure of the theme package and Views module.

Follow Drupal best practices.	
Build the solution for Drupal 10 or 11.

Business Task	
Functional requirements for the theme package and Views view:	
Use two Google fonts in the theme package.	
Create a link that opens a modal window with sample content.	
Style the Drupal Article and Basic Page content type views using the theme package.	
Create a chronological list view for the Article content type using the Views module.	
	Export this view as a separate module.
Create a menu with at least three sample pages (including the Articles list view created above).	
Write PHP code in the theme package to add a class to the body element based on the user’s role viewing the page (e.g., "admin" for an administrator).

Conclusion	
When complete, submit the theme package and module in a compressed format (zip, tar.gz, rar, etc.) or a link to the solution, along with documentation and the time spent on the task.
